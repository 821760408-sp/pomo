# üçÖ pomo

`pomo` is a simple CLI implementation of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). It was written for use on a Linux desktop but can easily be ported over to other platforms.

## Background

The Pomodoro Technique is simple and effective time management technique:

  * Decide on a task you want to accomplish
  * Break the task into timed intervals (pomodoros), [approx. 25 min]
  * After each pomodoro take a short break [approx. 3 - 5 min]
  * Once all pomodoros are completed take a longer break [approx 15 - 20 min]
  * Repeat
