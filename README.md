# üçÖ pomo

`pomo` is a simple CLI for using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). There are [some](https://taskwarrior.org/) [amazing](https://todoist.com/) task management systems but `pomo` is more of a task *execution* or [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) system. `pomo` helps you track what you did, how long it took you do it, and how much effort you expect it to take.

## Background

The Pomodoro Technique is simple and effective:

  * Decide on a task you want to accomplish
  * Break the task into timed intervals (pomodoros), [approx. 25 min]
  * After each pomodoro take a short break [approx. 3 - 5 min]
  * Once all pomodoros are completed take a longer break [approx 15 - 20 min]
  * Repeat
